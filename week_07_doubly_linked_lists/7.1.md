##Doubly-Linked Lists

There is certainly no reason why a linked list node must refer to only one other node. For the best flexibility when traversing a list, we might want to be connected in both directions: forward and backward. Whereas singly linked lists feature nodes that only know about their forward neighbor (unable to look backward), doubly linked lists are more like lines of preschoolers holding hands as they walk down the street together, on a field trip to the fire station. This expands our ability to easily iterate
back and forth through the dList, forming a much better parallel with our `idx` array iterator.

For the Doubly Linked List, all the concepts and techniques of Singly Linked Lists apply (see below). This extra flexibility comes with a cost, however. Maintaining both sets of pointers can be tedious.

Here is your challenge:

###DList Class

```js
function dlNode(value) {
  this.val = value;
  this.prev = null;
  this.next = null;
}

function dList() {
  this.head = null;
  this.tail = null;
}
```

Given the above reference implementations for doubly linked node and doubly linked list, construct the rest of a basic dList class. This would include dList methods `push()`, `pop()`, `front()`, `back()`, `contains()`, and `size()`.
