##Strings and Associative Arrays Day 2

###Parens Valid
Create a function that, given an input string `str`, returns a boolean whether parentheses in str are valid. Valid sets of parentheses always open before they close, for example. For `"Y(3(p)p(3)r)s"`, return `true`. Given `"N(0(p)3"`, return `false`: not every parenthesis is closed. Given `"N(0)t )0(k"`, return `false`.

###Is Palindrome
Strings like "Able was I, ere I saw Elba" or "Madam, I'm Adam" could be considered palindromes, because (if we ignore spaces, punctuation and capitalization) the letters are the same from back to front. Create a function that returns a boolean indicating whether the string is a strict palindrome. For `"a x a"` or `"racecar"`, return `true`. Do not ignore spaces, punctuation and capitalization: if given `"Dud"` or `"oho!"`, return `false`.
+ Next, ignore white space (spaces, tabs, returns), capitalization and punctuation.

###Is Word Alphabetical
Nikki, a queen of gentle sarcasm, loves the word *facetiously*. Lance helpfully points out that it is the only known English word that contains all five vowels in alphabetical order, and it even has a ‘y’ on the end! Nikki takes a break from debugging to turn and give him an acid stare that could only be described as *arsenious*. Given a string, return a boolean indicating whether all letters contained in that string are in alphabetical order.
