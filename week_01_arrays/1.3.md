##Arrays Day 3

###Array: Rotate
Implement `rotateArr(arr, shiftBy)` that accepts array and offset. Shift arr’s values to the right by that amount. ‘Wrap-around’ any values that shift off array’s end to the other side, so that no data is lost. Operate in-place: given ([1,2,3],1), change the array to [3,1,2]. Don’t use built-in functions.

* Second: allow negative shiftBy (shift L, not R).
* Third: minimize memory usage. With no new array, handle arrays/shiftBys in the millions.
* Fourth: minimize the touches of each element.

###Array: Filter Range
Alan is good at breaking secret codes. One tool is to eliminate numbers he knows are outside a certain specific range. Given `array` and values `min` and `max`, remove array values between min and max. Work in-place: return the array you are given, with values in original order. No built-in array functions.

###Array: Concat
Replicate JavaScript’s `concat()`. Create a standalone function that accepts two arrays. Return a new array containing the first array’s elements, followed by the second array’s elements. Do not alter the original arrays. Ex.: `arrConcat( ['a','b'], [1,2] )` should return new array `['a','b',1,2]`.
