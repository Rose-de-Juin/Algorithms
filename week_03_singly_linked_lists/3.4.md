##Singly Linked Lists Day 4

Here are your challenges:

###Split on Value
Create `splitOnVal(list,num)` that, given a number, splits a list in two. The latter half of the list should be returned, starting with node containing num. E.g.: `splitOnVal(5)` for the list `(1=>3=>5=>2=>4)` will change list to `(1=>3)`, and the return value will be `(5=>2=>4)`.

###Partition
Create `partition(list, value)` that locates the first node in the list with that value, and moves all nodes with values less than that value to be earlier, and all nodes with values greater than that value to be later. Original order need not be preserved. Return the new head listNode.
