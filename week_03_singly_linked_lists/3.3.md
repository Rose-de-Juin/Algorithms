##Singly Linked Lists Day 3

Here are your challenges:

###Min to Front
Create a standalone function that locates the minimum value in a linked list, and moves that node to the front of the list. Return the new list, with all nodes still present and (except for the new head node) in
their original order.

###Prepend Val
Create `prependVal(listNode,val,before)` to insert a new `listNode` with `val` *immediately before* the node containing `before` (or at end, if no node contains before). Return the new list.
  + Make another version that *appends* the new node (i.e. insert a new list node *immediately after* the node containing the function's third argument as a value.)
