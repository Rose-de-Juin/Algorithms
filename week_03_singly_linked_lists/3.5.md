##Singly Linked Lists Day 5 (Weekend)

Here are your challenges:

###Second to Last Value
Create a standalone function that, given a pointer to the first node in a singly-linked list, will return the second-to-last value in that list. If the list isn't long enough, return `null`.

###Filter
Given a `headNode`, `lowVal` and `highVal`, remove from the list any nodes that have values less than `lowVal` or higher than `highVal`. Return the new list.

###Remove Single Node (Challenging!)
Create a function `removeNode(node)` that takes in a pointer to *only* a single node (i.e. you don't have a pointer to the list itself) and remove it.
  * Here's a hint: You could be provided any node in the list *except* the last node.
