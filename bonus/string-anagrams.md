#String Anagrams
Given a string, return array where each element is a string representing a different anagram (a different sequence of the letters in that string). Example: if given `"lim"`, return `["ilm", "iml", "lim", "lmi", "mil", "mli"]`. For this challenge, you can use built-in string functions such as `split()`.
