##Queues & Stacks Day 5 (Weekend)

Here are your challenges:

###Queue: Is Palindrome
Given a Queue, return `true` if its values are a palindrome (if they are same in reverse order), else return `false`. Restore Queue to original state before exiting. For storage, use 1 additional Stack.

###Deque: Implementation
Create a class called Deque (pronounced ‘deck’) that represents a double-ended queue. In addition to the basic six methods, add versions that push and pop from the opposite ends. Specifically, create a class `deque`, containing methods `pushFront(val)`, `pushBack(val)`, `popFront()`, `popBack()`, `front()`, `back()`, `contains(val)`, `isEmpty()`, and `size()`.
