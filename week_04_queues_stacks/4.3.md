##Queues & Stacks Day 3

Here are your challenges (see previous days for constructor functions):

###Compare Queues
Given two `slQueue` objects, create a standalone function that returns whether they are equal. Queues are equal only if they have equal elements in identical order. Allocate no other object, and return the queues in their original condition upon exit.

###Remove Min
Create a standalone function to remove an `slQueue`â€™s lowest value, otherwise leaving values in the same sequence. Use only local variables; allocate no other objects. Remove all duplicates of this value.

###Interleave Queue
Reorder `slQueue` values to alternate first half values with second half values, in order. For example: `(1,2,3,4,5)` becomes `(1,4,2,5,3)`. You may create one additional slQueue, if needed.
