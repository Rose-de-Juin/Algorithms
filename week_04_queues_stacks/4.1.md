##Queues & Stacks

This week we'll learn about a couple of new data structures: the Stack and various flavors of Queues. It's important to remember that these data structures could be implemented in a number of ways, using different building blocks underneath. For this reason, data structures such as Queues are considered Abstract Data Types. They are considered abstract because the outward behavior of the data structure is well understood, but there is no requirement on how the data structure is constructed internally. We could choose to rewrite an existing Abstract Data Type, and as long as we maintain the same Abstract interface, there should be no problems.

##Queues

We can implement Queues in many ways, but we'll use a singly linked list (which you learned about last week), starting with:

```js
function node(value) {
  this.val = value;
  this.next = null;
}

function slQueue() {
  // Notice the use of var instead of this -- the head and tail are private variables
  var head = null; // these point
  var tail = null; // to node objs
}
```

Here are your challenges:

###Enqueue
Create `slQueue` method `enqueue(val)` to add the given value to *end* of our queue.

###Dequeue
Create `slQueue` method `dequeue()` to remove and return value at *front* of queue.

To create an `slQueue` method, you can attach functions to the `this` keyword *inside* the `slQueue` constructor function:

```js
function slQueue() {
  var head = null;
  var tail = null;

  this.someMethod = function(){
    // This function has access to head and tail...
  }
}
```
