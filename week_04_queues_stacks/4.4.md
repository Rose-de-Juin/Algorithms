##Queues & Stacks Day 4

###Stacks
Stacks and Queues are companion data structures. Both are sequential, meaning they manage data according to the order in which they were added. A Queue data structure operates by a principle of “First-In becomes First-Out” (FIFO); a Stack is quite the opposite (Last-In, First-Out or LIFO).

Consider a pile of papers. With this stack of papers, we can only get a good look at the top of the pile. When we add another paper, that page becomes the only one visible. We can only add and remove papers from the top. We cannot add a page mid-stack (just as one should not cut into the middle of a queue at the ice cream store). In this way, Stacks and Queues mirror one another. Their methods correspond: substitute push / pop / top for enqueue / dequeue / front, and they become identical.

Your challenges are to implement a **stack** based on an array by building the following methods:

###Push
Create `push(val)` that adds val to our stack.

###Pop
Create `pop()` to remove and return the top val.

###Top
Return (not remove) the stack’s top value.

###Contains
Return whether given val is within the stack.

###Is Empty
Return whether the stack is empty.

###Size
Return the number of stacked values.

Now try to implement the same Stack methods, except use a singly-linked list instead of an array.
