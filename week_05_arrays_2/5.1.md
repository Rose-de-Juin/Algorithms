##Arrays II Day 1

Here are your challenges:

###Balance Point
Write a function that returns whether the given array has a balance point between indices, where one side’s sum is equal to the other’s. Example: `[1,2,3,4,10]` → `true` (between indices 3 & 4), but `[1,2,4,2,1]` → `false`.

###Balance Index
Here, a balance point is *on* an index, not between indices. Return the balance index where sums are equal on either side (exclude its own value). Return `-1` if none exist. Ex.: `[- 2,5,7,0,3]` → `2`, but `[9,9]` → `-1`.
