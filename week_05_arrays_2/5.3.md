##Arrays II Day 3

Here are your challenges:

###Binary Search
Given *sorted* array and value, return whether array contains it. *Do not sequentially iterate the array.* Instead, ‘divide and conquer’, taking advantage of the fact that the array is sorted. Given `[4,6,77,84,199], 6`, return `true`.

###Rain Terraces
The Seattle Coding Dojo wants to send excess water to the Burbank Coding Dojo, so it landscapes its rooftop with a set of unusual elevated terraces. The terraces are all the same width, but have varying heights. When it rains, water gathers in the low terraces that are surrounded by taller ones. For example, if we have terraces with heights `[3,1,1,4,2]`, then as much as 4 units of water could be gathered, because water would pool 2-deep on two different terraces (both of the 1-high terraces: between the 3-high and 4-high terraces). Water on the other terraces just runs off the sides. Given an array of terrace heights, *return the maximum amount of water* that is trapped when rains come.
