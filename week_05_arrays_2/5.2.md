##Arrays II Day 2

Here's today's challenge:

###Taco Truck
Joe drives a taco truck in the booming town of Squaresburg. He uses an array of `[x,y]` coordinates corresponding to locations of his customers. They walk to his truck, but he is fair-minded so he wants to minimize total distance from truck to customers. City blocks are perfect squares, and every street is two-way, at perfect right angles. He only parks by street corners (coordinates like `[37,-16]`). Customers *only travel on streets*: coordinate `[2,-2]` is distance `4` from `[0,0]`. Joe checks the array before deciding where to park. Given a customer coordinate array, return an optimal taco truck location. Example: given `[ [10,0], [-1,-10], [2,4] ]`, return `[2,0]`, as total distance is `25` (`8`+`13`+`4`).
